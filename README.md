## Orchestra RPG
The website also features an activity for students in the Chamber and Concert classes. It is a website that allows students to create a character and then complete assignments to improve their character's stats. Students earn more stats the better they perform the assignement. Students are encouraged to complete extra tasks and collaborate with other students. The website also contains an grader and student stats so they can see how they compare with other students. This page was created with the help of William Wang, Katie Stenner, Kasudie Burton and Jaden Eaglin.

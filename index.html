            As an active performer, Mr. Williams has served as Concertmaster of
            the Fairfax Chamber Players and the VCU Symphony Orchestra. In high
            school, he earned a seat in the All-Virginia Orchestra on double

            Justin began his public school teaching career in St. Louis,
            Missouri with the Riverview Gardens School District. Mr. Williams
            thrived in the underserved and underfunded environment by initiating
            new instructional methods and extracurricular programs. In 2014, he
            was voted as Teacher of the Year. Mr. Williams was then employed as
            one of the orchestra directors for Centreville High School and

            programs in the state of Virginia. He is currently the AP Music
